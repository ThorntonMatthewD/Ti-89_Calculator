**Project Title:** ti-a11y.solutions
 
&nbsp;

**Project Description:**

This application is a command line calculator designed for blind or visually impaired students who are enrolled in  math classes. It benefits them to access the information while using their screen reader the same as sighted students in their classroom.

&nbsp;

**Requirements prior to usage:**

Install Python 3.10, and the math, sympy, and statistics libraries with "pip install <library>".

&nbsp;

**To run the application:**
  
Clone or copy the code in main.py and UserGuide.py. Ensure that they are in the same directory.

In the command line or terminal, navigate to the directory where main.py and UserGuide.py are.
  
Enter: "python main.py". This launches the calculator.
  
The calculator will begin by listing the different modes:
  
Real Numbers (basic calculator functions)
 
Derivatives (to calculate derivatives)
  
Integral (to calculate indefinite and definite integrals)
  
Statistics (to work with statistics)
 
Algebra (to solve algebraic equations)
  
User Guide (to get a list of functions within the other modes and to help answer any questions about how to use the application).

&nbsp;
  
To use the real mode, type "r", "R", or "real" from the main screen.
To use the real mode, type "d", "D", or "derivatives" from the main screen.
To use the real mode, type "i", "I", or "integral" from the main screen.
To use the real mode, type "s", "S", or "statistics" from the main screen.
To use the real mode, type "a", "A", or "algebra" from the main screen.
To use the real mode, type "u", "U", or "user" from the main screen.
  
&nbsp;

Once in a mode, you can perform calculations and operations per the instructions in the User Guide. 
  
The calculator will keep building on itself as you enter formulas, so if you ever want to reset it, type "clear".
  
You can also switch modes by typing "switch" at anytime in a mode. You will then be prompted to pick a new mode.
  
"back"
  
&nbsp;

Options are provided in derivative, integral, algebra and user guide sections.

User guides explain how to use specific commands for each mode.

Typing “q” or “quit” closes the program. “O” or “options” provides a list of options in a menu.

**Accessibility**

The developer uses JAWS and Focus 40 Blue (refreshable Braille display) to access this program in PowerShell. Pressing the right rotor bar allows her to pan up to read the information above the command line.
